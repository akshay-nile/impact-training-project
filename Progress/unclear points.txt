Patient can also propose any changes to his/her captured data------------
Is patient supposed to change his details taken by nurse, 
like weight, height, BP etc? But why?

Patient's medications and diagnoses for a visit are recorded------------
Recorded by whome? Doctor or nurse.
because medication and diagnoses can we given by doctors only.
nurses don't write these things.

For the first visit, Nurse also validates the data entered by patient while registration---------
Patient's registration is approved by Admin only, then why this step is needed?
